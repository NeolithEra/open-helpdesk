Installation
============
The easiest method is to install directly from pypi using `pip`_ by
running the command below, which will also install the required
dependencies mentioned above::

    $ pip install open-helpdesk

If you prefer, you can download ``OpenHelpdesk`` and install it directly from
source::

    $ python setup.py install
